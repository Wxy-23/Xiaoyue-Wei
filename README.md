# Hey, I'm Xiaoyue ðŸ‘‹

I'm a M.S. Computational Analysis and Public Policy graduate from the University of Chicago. I am interested in civic technology, artificial intelligence, and social entrepreneurship. The policy areas I am passionate about are technology, international development, education, and social inclusion, and I am eager to explore broader policy topics. 

You can see a few of my projects at the links below:

* **Machine Learning Models to Predict Passage of Tech Bills**. Built predictive models to forecast whether Illinois state-level technology bills will pass or fail, addressing the need for greater transparency in policymaking for political analysts, advocacy groups, and policymakers. Using logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and K-Nearest Neighbors with word embeddings, I led data source identification, feature engineering from bill texts and legislative metadata, and model evaluation. The analysis revealed that cosponsorship is the most predictive feature for legislative success across different models, highlighting the critical role of political coalition-building in policy outcomes.

* **CMAP Stormwater Infrastructure Classification**. Developed a deep learning model to automatically identify stormwater infrastructure types from aerial images, helping the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning create northeastern Illinois's first comprehensive infrastructure inventory to combat flooding and climate change impacts. Through data engineering and automated hyperparameter tuning, I improved the model's Intersection over Union by 15.8% and integrated river and Digital Elevation Model data. This project taught me advanced computer vision techniques and the importance of systematic model optimization in real-world applications.

* **U.S. Electricity Generation Data Visualization**. Created interactive dashboards visualizing America's energy transition by exploring relationships between renewable vs non-renewable sources, prices, and CO2 emissions across states over time. Using Python, pandas, and plotly, I processed energy data from SQL databases and built trend visualization functions while managing the challenges of inconsistent historical data formats. This project deepened my understanding of data pipeline development and the complexities of working with real-world time series data.

## Notable Projects & Leadership

* **AI Policy Analysis & Writing Portfolio**. Conducted comprehensive research on U.S. AI governance fragmentation that creates $1 trillion in potential compliance costs and inconsistent citizen protections, developing strategic recommendations for a unified federal framework. Through comparative analysis of international models (EU and China) and economic impact assessment, I learned policy analysis methodologies and the delicate balance between fostering innovation and protecting citizens in emerging technology regulation. I learned communication techniques to deliver research insights and actionable recommendations to a broad audience with persuasion.

* **Data, Ethics, and Policy Conference 2024: Governance in a Digital World** - Led student organization of this conference bringing together thought leaders from academia, industry, government, and community organizations. Won Outstanding Program award from Harris School of Public Policy. [Event website](https://www.data-ethics-policy.com/home)

* **Hacking for Defense Program - U.S. Air Force Contracting Process Optimization** - This project aims to find innovative solution for the Air Force procurement office to optimize their contracting process. My team conducted 40+ hours of stakeholder interviews to identify engagement barriers and validated a $74B market opportunity for workforce innovation, and developed a strategic proposal for a gamified platform to address employee disengagement.
